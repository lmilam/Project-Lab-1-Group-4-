# Project-Lab-1-Group-4-
# Main Project: Autonomous Search and Destroy

Design and develop an autonomous vehicle capable of following a track comprised of 1” reflective tape.
At three points along the way the track will be covered by a 1” by 2” rectangle of bright red tape. When
your vehicle reaches these marks, it must stop and fire a projectile at a target randomly positioned to
the right or left of the track.

The targets will be marked by a bright white LED flashing at a frequency of approximately 20 Hz. The
targets will be 12 inches in diameter with the bull’s eye placed 1.5 feet off the floor. The three targets
will be placed at distances of 2, 4, and 6 feet perpendicular from the track. Once your vehicle has fired
upon the 3rd and final target, it must return to the start of the track which will be indicated by a 1” by 2”
rectangle of green tape.
